🏠 Housing Data Analysis of Metropolitan Cities

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes housing data from major metropolitan cities in India using Python. The goal is to explore the dataset, understand market trends, and derive insights about housing prices, locations, and amenities.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle: "Housing Dataset in Metropolitan Combined".

🔎 Steps Performed in the Notebook

1. Importing Libraries

  •	Loaded essential libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

2. Data Loading & Exploration

  •	Loaded dataset (merged_files.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame.

  •	Displayed first & last rows (head(), tail()).

  •	Checked dataset shape → 32,963 rows × 41 columns.

  •	Used .info() and .describe() for data types, missing values, and summary stats.

3. Data Cleaning

  •	Identified null values and handled them where necessary.

  •	Converted data types (like numerical conversions for price/area).

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  •	Distribution of property prices and area.

  •	Price variation across cities.

  •	Average price per city.

  •	Top 10 locations with most listings.

  •	Top 10 locations with highest average price.

  •	Most common amenities across houses.


5. Feature Analysis

  •	Effect of Gymnasium on housing price.

  •	Effect of Swimming Pool on housing price.

  •	Correlation analysis (e.g., between price, area, and bedrooms).

6. Key Insights

  •	Mumbai has the highest total housing prices, followed by Delhi.

  •	Delhi has the highest average property cost, while Hyderabad is the most affordable.

  •	Noida leads in terms of housing demand with the most listings.

  •	Premium locations (like 15th Road) have the highest average prices, indicating luxury markets.

  •	Amenities like Gymnasium and Swimming Pool significantly increase housing prices.

  •	Strong correlation between area and number of bedrooms, while price is moderately correlated with area.
